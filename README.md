🎮 Console Game Collection – C++ Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of individual console-based games developed as part of my personal journey to improve my skills in:

Programming logic

Algorithms

Data structures

Sorting and searching techniques

All games are written in C++, designed to make learning fun and practical.

📁 What's Inside

Each file in this repository is a standalone game — no setup required. Just open it, compile, and enjoy!

These games are not just for entertainment — they also demonstrate practical use of:

Control flow and logic building

Use of arrays, linked lists, and other data structures

Sorting and searching algorithms in action

Input handling and basic console UI

💡 Purpose

I created these games to turn algorithm practice into something more enjoyable than textbook problems. They're small, focused, and built with learning in mind.

▶️ How to Run

Open any .cpp file in your favorite C++ IDE or editor

Compile and run — no external libraries required

Play and explore how the code works!

Feel free to explore, learn, and even extend them further!
